This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked error in React applications: the missing return statement within a useEffect hook.  The example shows a counter component. The original code omits the necessary cleanup function in useEffect, which can lead to memory leaks if the component unmounts before the effect completes.  The solution demonstrates how to fix the issue and prevent these memory leaks.
